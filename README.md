<h4>Sicherer - Simple Website Backups</h4>
Sicherer is a CLI tool that lets you backup your website (files & MySQL database) and upload it to Azure Blob Storage. It is created and maintained by [Fabian Hurnaus](https://fahu.at).

<strong>Note: Sicherer is in a very early stage of development. I do not guarantee an error-free execution of the tool nor do I adhere for any non-expecting behavior (e.g. deletion of files).</strong>
